# Lackluster colorscheme for Sway window manager

The author very much prefers the mint flavor of the Neovim theme, thus the example configuration
is also mint based. Base black is #101010 over #080808. Feel feel to tweak the colors and highlights as you please.
Colors are set as variables for ease of use.

## Usage
Either copy the code in `colors` directly in your Sway config file, 
or use the `include <colors file>` directive.
