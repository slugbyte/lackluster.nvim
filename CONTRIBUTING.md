# CONTRIBUTING? Thanks for the help <3
I love to enable people to contribute, and welcome suggestions and PRs! I do however have
strong preferences for the aesthetics of lackluster and I reserve the right to modify or 
reject any contributions as I see fit.

## LACKLUSTER GOALS
> These goals should be kept in mind when making a contribution :)
* Maximize code readability and minimize visual noise
* Make it easy to quickly visually identify...
  * Function and type definitions
  * Function return and exception points
  * Function calls
  * Builtin modules and functions
  * Diagnostic errors
* Support commonly used neovim plugins
* Be easy on the eyes

## Bugs 
If you find a bug please open a ticket :) If the issue is color related, please include a
screenshot.

## Spellcheck
I'm super dyslexic, and do my best with spellcheck, but that only works so well. So if 
you find a spelling error free to directly open a PR, no need to create an issue first :)

## Suggestions, Feature Request, General Input
If you have some input or a feature request, please open a discussion issue before opening a PR.
I'm open to new Ideas I just want chat about them first.

## Contributing New Features Process
1) Open A `Contribution Proposal` ticket an let me know what you want to work on :)
2) Get an Approval
3) Make your feature and open a Pull Request
4) Get a review, and potentially be asked for a few changes
5) Get merged!!!

Your the best! Thanks so much for contributing!

#### What To Put In your feature Pull Request?
A description of you feature, and a screenshot of what it looks like on your machine.

If you are adding support for a new plugin/extra tool, please add a code block containing
the your configuration for that plugin/tool so that I can test it out easier :)

## TODO / GREAT FIRST ISSUE
I plan on slowly adding support for the following tools, and would love help if anyone is
interested in contributing :)

I don't use these plugins so I makes it quite a bit of work to implement my self, so this
will probably be a slow long term effort.
